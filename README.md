# 🎬 Why Are Movies Around Two Hours Long?

Welcome to the analysis of movie runtimes! This project investigates why most movies tend to have a duration of around two hours. We explore historical trends, genre differences, and the relationship between movie length and ratings.

## 🔍 Research Questions
✅ **How has movie length changed over time, and why?**  
✅ **Which movie genres were popular in different eras, and how do their runtimes differ?**  
✅ **Is there a correlation between movie runtime and ratings?**

## 📈 Key Findings

### ⏳ Movie Length Over Time
Movies have gradually become longer, with significant fluctuations in different eras:
- **Early 1900s:** Limited by film reel capacity (10-15 minutes per reel).
- **1920s:** Advancements in film splicing allowed longer movies, but runtimes varied significantly.
- **1940s:** The introduction of television led to time constraints for broadcast-friendly films.
- **1980s:** The rise of VHS tapes imposed a 120-minute limit.
- **1990s-Present:** DVDs and digital streaming eliminated physical constraints, leading to longer films.
- **Recent Trends:** Competition with OTT platforms influences runtime decisions.

📌 **Key Insight:** Changes in **film distribution technology** significantly impacted movie runtimes.

### 🎭 Popular Genres Through the Decades
Analyzing the dataset revealed shifts in movie genre popularity:
- **1950s:** Drama and comedy dominated.
- **1960s-1970s:** The rise of action films.
- **2010s-Present:** Action movies consistently hold the top spot.

📌 **Key Insight:** The evolution of **audience preferences** and **film technology** shaped genre trends.

### ⏳ Runtime Differences Across Genres
- **Longest average runtimes:** Musical films (~216 mins) & Biopics (~140 mins)
- **Shortest runtimes:** Animation (~93 mins) & Horror (~80 mins)

📌 **Key Insight:** **Story complexity** and **target audience** influence runtime.

### ⭐ Does Movie Length Affect Ratings?
A scatter plot analysis of **runtime vs. IMDb ratings** shows **no strong correlation** between the two.

📌 **Key Insight:** Movie length **does not significantly impact ratings**—other factors like storytelling quality and production value play a bigger role.
